## Features

**Existing Features**
- Visible score

At any time you can see your current score. You can also see the score it takes to win the game and how many tried you have left. This updates automatically after each round. 

- Rules button

In the bottom right corner there is a "Rules" button. Upon clicking it you see a visual representation of the rules. Which choice counteracts which other choice. 

- Dark/Light mode

There is a little sun-icon, it's clickable and upon clicking it you change into different colour modes. One is darker and the other is brighter. 

- The different choices

Players see the different choices immediately upon loading the webpage. After the player picks one choice they then will see their choice on the left side and the House choice on the right.

- You Lose/You Win/Draw

When the player has hade their choice and it appears alongside with the House's choice, there will appear a text saying who won or if it was a draw. 

-  Footer

On the bottom of the website there is a simple footer. Linking to my Github.


**Future Features**
- Leaderboard so players can check their highscores and see progression.
- Clear button for highscores so that players have the choice to remove current highscores and add new ones. 
- Reset button so players can start anew whenever they desire

## Design

- This site has two colour themes, a light and dark theme. For the light theme #F8927F is used as the background, with complimentary peaches and blacks. #0f0005 is used for the dark theme where whites and various colors are used to compliment this darker background.
- For the typography, Oswald was chosen for its classic, timeless look, as well as for matching with the images used in the site.
- The images were chosen to match with the font and colour schemes, taken from a coding challenge by Fontend Mentor. This challenge provided the full suite of images for the website, keeping the look consistent between each image and for the entire site.

**Problems**
- My assets folder should have been named assets. I named it "rovkpaperscissors" which isn't standard practice and made me run into some code issues when I wrote file paths under /assets. 
Since I already had files in that folder I could not easily rename it but it is something to improve in the future. What I would need to do is create a new assets folder named "assets" and move all files there, aswell as re-path all the files in HTML,CSS and JS. 
- My mentor went took a few weeks holiday.  I contacted Student Care aswell as submitted a form for a new mentor during that time. Never got any mentor. My original mentor is fantastic and helpful but since he was on vacation I had to rely on one person, myself, which was horrible and tedious since I obviously know barely anything. Every question, error, frustration or flaw I encountered I had to guess my way through it on my own.
